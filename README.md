This was a Data Engineering project wherein AWS services were used for the following steps

1. Build a mechanism to ingest data from different sources (Eg- Kaggle)
2. Getting data in raw format, transforming this data into the proper format
3. Getting data from multiple sources so we need centralized repo to store them (AWS S3)
4. As the size of data increases, we need to make sure our system scales with it (AWS Glue)
5. AWS Lambda as it is a computing service that allows programmers to run code without creating or managing servers.
6. AWS Athena as it is an interactive query service for S3 in which there is no need to load data it stays in S3.
7. Build a dashboard using parameters to analyze and find answers. (Quicksight).
